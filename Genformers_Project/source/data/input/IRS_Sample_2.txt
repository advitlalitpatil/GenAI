of a 100% stock dividend. As a result of the stock split, each holder of record of Sempra's common stock at the close of business on the
record date received one additional share of common stock for every then-held share of common stock. The record date for the stock split
was August 14, 2023, and the new shares were distributed after the close of trading on August 21, 2023.
Participants in Sempra's Direct Stock Purchase Plan ("DSPP") that hold fractional shares in their DSPP account were credited with a book­
entry fractional share to the extent a fraction results from the stock split.
15 Describe the quantitative effect of the organizational action on the basis of the security in the hands of a U.S. taxpayer as an adjustment per
share or as a percentage of old basis ► |n accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 307(a), each shareholder is required to allocate
the aggregate tax basis in his or her shares held immediately prior to the stock split among the shares held immediately after the stock split.
The stock split will decrease the basis of each share of stock issued and outstanding before the split ("Old Shares") by one-half, or 50%. To
compute the new per share basis, the Old Share basis of each share is divided by two, and 50% is allocated to the newly issued share and
50% remains with the Old Share. Note that where lots of shares held prior to August 21, 2023 were acquired at different times or for________
different prices, the basis allocation should be done on a lot-by-lot basis.
16 Describe the calculation of the change in basis and the data that supports the calculation, such as the market values of securities and the
valuation dates ► The 2-for-1 stock split does not change the aggregate basis of the shares held by the shareholder, it merely
allocates the Old Share basis equally between the Old Share and the newly issued share (see response to #15).
Example:______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Before the 2-for-1 stock split: A stockholder holds 100 shares of common stock with a basis of $10 per share.____________________
Total basis equals $1,000 (100 shares x $10 = $1,000).
After the 2-for-1 stock split: A stockholder holds 200 shares of common stock with a basis of $5 per share._______________________
Total basis equals $1,000 (200 shares x $5 = $1,000).
